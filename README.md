### INTRODUCTION:
Shark attacks reported over the past 100 years, including location, activity, victim info (name, gender, age), shark species, etc. 
The analysis of the Shark attack dataset underwent thorough data cleansing, addressing missing values, irregularities, and inconsistencies. Utilizing Tableau, it extracted valuable insights reveals intriguing patterns of shark attacks and species.

### OBJECTIVES:
Shark attacks reported over the past 100 years, including location, activity, victim info (name, gender, age), shark species, etc.
We are to find out more informations about the attacks.

### RECOMMENDATED_ANALYSIS
1. Make a graph of number of shark attacks annually over time since 1900. What trends do 
you see? 
2. Which countries report the most shark attacks? Within those countries, which areas and 
locations seem to be the most dangerous? 
4. What body parts are most often injured? (hint: you'll need to perform text analysis on the 
Injury column) 
5. Are shark attacks more common during certain parts of the day (again, the Time data isn't 
quite ready to go. You may need to transform it before analyzing) 
6. Which species of shark are attacking most often? (you guessed it... this data is messy too!)
